# Changelog

## v1.1.0 — 2026-07-06 (Bug Fixes)

### BUG-1 — Manage dashboard error state wired up
- `error` state in `Manage.tsx` was declared but never set or displayed
- `togglePause` and `handleReveal` now catch errors and surface them in the existing `mp-error-box` element
- Error is cleared on each new action attempt

### BUG-2 — Profile "Listed" badge now works
- `/api/marketplace/offers/board?nft_ids=...` now accepts a comma-separated NFT ID list and returns only those with active asks
- Profile page listing check uses this lightweight endpoint; "Listed" badge appears correctly on owned NFTs that have open asks

### BUG-3 — Trait filter pills visually disabled when not indexed
- `.mp-trait-pill.info-only` was missing CSS — pills had `cursor:pointer` and hover styles even though clicking did nothing
- Added `pointer-events: none; opacity: 0.5; cursor: default` and overrode hover to make the inactive state unambiguous

### BUG-4 — Activity tab paginated (Load More)
- Activity endpoint hard-capped at 50 events with no way to load more
- Server: added `?offset=` query param; response shape is now `{ events: [], hasMore: boolean }`; old array response still accepted client-side for backwards compatibility
- Frontend: "Load More" button appears when `hasMore: true`; appends to existing list; spinner replaces button while loading

### BUG-5 — Wallet connect prompt in NFT modal
- Without a wallet address in localStorage, Buy/List/Make Offer buttons rendered but silently failed when clicked
- NFT modal action area now shows "Open the wallet to buy, list, or make offers" + "Open Wallet" button (opens `/` in new tab) when no wallet is connected

### Backend
- `trending.js`: score formula now uses 7-day daily average as fallback when `sales_24h = 0`; eliminates "0 with score > 0" when there's no same-day activity
- `trending.js`: `sales7d` added as parameter to `computeScore` (was computed but never passed in)
- `marketplace.js`: traits endpoint returns `{ filterable: boolean, traits: {} }` instead of bare object; cache TTL is 2 min when `filterable: false` (backfill in progress) vs 30 min when fully indexed
- `marketplace.js`: `isIndexed` in `Collection.tsx` now uses `traitsFilterable` from the explicit server flag instead of inferring from gallery items' trait presence

## v1.4.0 — 2026-07-02 (Quick Wins: Polish & Discovery)

### QW1 — Verified badges
- Blue ✓ badge on browse cards for verified collections (`verified` column in `indexed_collections`)

### QW2 — Per-trait rarity % in NFT modal
- Each trait chip now shows rarity percentage (e.g. "Background: Forest — 12.3%"), calculated from collection-wide trait counts vs indexed supply

### QW3 — Sort dropdown on collection gallery
- "Token order" and "Rarity: rarest first" options; sort propagated server-side so pagination stays consistent

### QW4 — Grid size toggle (large / compact)
- Large/compact toggle on gallery header; preference persisted in `localStorage`
- Compact mode: smaller tiles, hidden hover-traits, tighter gap

### QW5 — Creator address links to profile
- Creator address in collection header is now a clickable link to `/marketplace/profile?address=...`

### QW6 — Listed count on browse cards
- Active asks per collection aggregated in trending job and surfaced on browse cards ("X listed")
- Migration `019_listed_count.sql`: adds `listed_count` column to `indexed_collections`

### QW7 — Allowlist CSV upload in creator wizard
- "Upload CSV" button in step 8 parses xch1 addresses from any CSV/TXT file and merges into the allowlist textarea; deduplicates on import

### QW8 — Revenue sparkline in creator dashboard
- 30-day daily revenue area chart (recharts AreaChart) above the orders table; computed client-side from existing orders state

### QW9 — Wallet-agnostic USP copy on mint panel
- "No browser extension needed — works with any Chia wallet · Sage · Chia Light · Nucle · CLI" added below QR code

### QW10 — Floor price delta indicator
- Floor stat shows ↑/↓ % vs 7-day average sale price when meaningful (>1% delta); computed from existing `collStats.volume_7d_mojo / sales_7d`

### Backend
- Gallery endpoint: returns `rarity_rank` per item; accepts `?sort=rarity` param
- Trending job: aggregates `listed_count` per collection from `nft_offers → indexed_nfts`
- External browse API: exposes `listed_count` and `verified`

## v1.3.0 — 2026-07-01 (Trending, Dexie Backfill, Multi-Token Offers)
- feat: Dexie volume backfill (`server/dexie-backfill.js`) — 355k trades across 1000+ collections
- feat: Trending score job (`server/trending.js`) — 15-min background job; score = vol24h × √(1+acceleration) × log(1+sales24h)
- feat: Multi-token offers — CAT wallet picker in offer panel; `nft_offers`/`nft_transfers` support non-XCH tokens
- feat: Marketplace All page sorted: trending → live minting → minted_count
- fix: Paginated `fetchVolume()` removes Supabase 1000-row cap on stats
- fix: Partial unique index → full unique index for PostgREST upsert compatibility (migration 016)
- fix: `mint_24h` excluded from trending score (was inflating counts via re-indexing)
- fix: Watcher retry loop capped at 5 attempts; bogus orders auto-cancelled; skipped coins logged once

- feat: `supabase/migrations/001_initial.sql` — full schema: projects, layers, variants, incompatibilities, generated_tokens with RLS + realtime notes
- feat: `server/index.js` — Express API server on port 3002 with full CORS allowlist; 8 routes: create project, upload layers, save variants/weights/incompatibilities, preview (5 samples), generate (BullMQ queue or synchronous fallback), status, rarity report, IPFS pin
- feat: `server/generation.js` — Hashlips-style weighted trait selection with incompatibility checking, uniqueness enforcement, `@napi-rs/canvas` image compositing (prebuilt Windows x64 binaries), Supabase Storage upload, per-token DB records, live progress updates
- feat: `server/ipfs.js` — NFT.storage HTTP API upload of all images + CHIP-0007 metadata JSON per token; updates token records with `ipfs://` URIs
- feat: `src/create/index.tsx` — 8-step creator wizard: New Project → Layer Upload → Trait Config (weights + incompatibility rules) → Preview (5 samples) → Generate (Realtime progress via Supabase channel + polling fallback) → Rarity Report (recharts BarChart per layer) → IPFS Pin → Launch link
- feat: `src/lib/supabase.ts` — Supabase frontend client from `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` / `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- feat: `.env` updated with `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `VITE_API_URL` for Vite frontend exposure

- infra: `@napi-rs/canvas` replaces `node-canvas` for Windows-compatible prebuilt binaries
- infra: `server/` directory added to repo with own `package.json`; output images excluded from git

## v0.13.0 — 2026-06-27 (Platform Restructure)
- refactor: installed react-router-dom; set up `createBrowserRouter` in `src/main.tsx`
- refactor: moved wallet code from `src/` to `src/wallet/`; `src/lib/*` to `src/wallet/lib/*`
- feat: routes: `/` → WalletApp, `/create` → CreateScreen (placeholder), `/marketplace` → MarketplaceScreen (placeholder)

## v0.12.0 — 2026-06-27 (Security Hardening & Polish)
- fix: CORS wildcard replaced with origin-allowlist in chia-proxy — localhost always allowed; production origins via `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` env var; `Vary: Origin` header set
- fix: Change Password now verifies current password before re-encrypting — decrypts one wallet with re-derived key before any state changes; errors clearly as "incorrect password"
- fix: Salt race condition in Change Password — `generateSalt()` and `storeSalt()` split; salt only committed to localStorage after all wallets successfully re-encrypted
- fix: Mixed-content warning in Settings — shown when app is on HTTPS but proxy URL is HTTP
- fix: HistoryScreen state reset on deps change — `setEvents([])`, `setError('')`, `setLoading(true)` at effect start prevents stale history on wallet/node switch
- fix: Local proxy option now selectable from node dropdown — sentinel value `__local__` clears the custom URL field instead of being excluded from the list
- ux: Proxy URL test button in Settings — fetches `/price/xch` with 5s timeout, shows latency or error inline
- ux: In-app transaction confirmation toast — slides up from bottom nav, auto-dismisses after 4s; fires on `pollConfirmation` success
- ux: Password strength indicator on wallet creation and Change Password — animated bar: Weak / Fair / Strong with color feedback
- ux: Seed phrase backup reminder banner — shows on first wallet creation, dismissible, persisted to localStorage
- test: Forgot Password wipe-and-restore flow — verifies lock screen → wipe → setup screen + localStorage cleared
- test: Change Password wrong-password rejection — verifies `error-msg` appears with "incorrect" text when current password is wrong

## v0.11.0 — 2026-06-27 (Bug Fixes & Web Deployment)
- fix: HistoryScreen `useEffect` now re-runs on wallet switch and nodeUrl change — history reloads correctly when switching wallets or configuring a node mid-session
- fix: SetupScreen 'password' mode adds Back button — user can return to quiz (new wallet) or import form
- fix: LockScreen Forgot Password recovery path — "Restore from seed phrase" link with wipe-and-restore confirmation; prevents users from being permanently locked out
- refactor: removed orphaned `sendXch` / `selectCoins` from spend.ts — XCH send path now uses `walletRpc` directly like clawback; proxy URL unified
- fix: proxy full-node RPC route adds 20s timeout matching the wallet daemon route
- feat: Change Password in Settings — re-derives key, re-encrypts all wallets with new salt; takes effect immediately for the session
- feat: Idle auto-lock — configurable inactivity timeout (5/15/30/60 min / never); tracks mouse, keyboard, click, touch events
- ux: removed redundant "Your Address" card from WalletHome — balance card → Assets without the copy row
- feat: Proxy URL configurable in Settings — stored in localStorage; overrides `VITE_PROXY_URL`; `cats.ts` and `walletRpc` both read it dynamically
- feat: Public Chia node dropdown in Settings — quick-select SpeedFarmer, Chia Official, or type custom URL
- feat: Vercel/Netlify deploy config — `vercel.json` and `netlify.toml` with SPA rewrites and security headers
- feat: `.env.example` checked in — documents `VITE_PROXY_URL` for production deployments

## v0.10.0 — 2026-06-27 (Portfolio, Polish & Security)
- feat: Password-derived mnemonic encryption — PBKDF2 (600k iterations) + AES-256-GCM via Web Crypto API; mnemonics never stored in plaintext; existing wallets forced through one-time migration to set a password; password re-prompted on each page reload (MetaMask pattern)
- feat: Total portfolio USD value — XCH + all priced CAT holdings summed to a single fiat total in the balance card; visible whenever at least one CAT has a known price
- feat: Coin consolidation / UTXO merge — "Consolidate coins" action in WalletHome sends full XCH balance back to primary address, forcing daemon to merge all UTXOs; configurable fee
- fix: ReceiveScreen address cap — "Show more" now reveals all 50 derived addresses instead of capping at 20
- fix: `calculateCoinId` concurrency — replaced unbounded `Promise.all` with `mapConcurrent(items, 20)` in HistoryScreen; prevents event-loop stall on 200+ coin wallets

## v0.9.0 — 2026-06-27 (Security & Critical Fixes)
- feat: Hot wallet security banner — persistent unencrypted-storage warning with per-session dismiss
- feat: Reveal seed phrase in Settings — show/hide/copy mnemonic after wallet creation (like MetaMask's "Reveal SRP")
- feat: Seed phrase verification quiz — require re-entering 3 random words before opening a new wallet; wrong answers blocked with clear error
- fix: BigInt-safe `walletRpc` serializer — all wallet daemon calls now emit raw integer literals via custom JSON serializer; no more `Number(bigint)` precision loss above ~9,007 XCH
- fix: `formatMojoToXch` precision — replaced `Number(mojo)/1e12` with pure BigInt arithmetic; all balance displays correct at any amount
- fix: Clawback and Offers screens use native bigint amounts — `Number()` casts removed from all `walletRpc` calls in `SendScreen` and `OffersScreen`
- fix: Stale `balance` closure in `WalletHome.fetchAll` — replaced stale-state guard with a `hasLoadedRef`; no more spurious "Cannot reach proxy" on transient failures
- fix: `localStorage` cache size caps — `puzzleCache` capped at 500 entries, `phAssetCache` at 2000; oldest entries evicted to prevent silent `setItem` failure and cache divergence
- test: 3 new Playwright tests — quiz appears after confirm, quiz rejects wrong words, Settings reveals seed phrase (15 tests total)

## v0.8.0 — 2026-06-27 (On-Chain Trading & History)
- feat: Take offer — paste an `offer1…` string, decode terms, one-tap atomic settlement via wallet daemon
- feat: Create offer — build XCH↔CAT offer strings, copy or submit to Dexie
- feat: Clawback sends — optional 10min/1hr/24hr recall window on XCH sends; pending rows in history with Recall button
- feat: Transaction detail — tap any history row to expand block, mojo amount, coin ID, Spacescan link
- fix: CAT history gap — fully-spent tokens now labelled via `phAssetCache` + `getTokenMetadata` fallback
- feat: Pending mempool transactions — submitted sends appear as "Pending" in history until confirmed or expired
- test: HistoryScreen — no-node empty state and scanning state with configured node (2 new tests, 12 total)

## v0.1.0 — 2026-06-25 (Initial Build)
